This is a learning project and it supports my issue-tracker project which needs file uploading and retrieval capabilities. 

This project will demonstrate the following:

- Attach files to a simple form using Filepond library.
- Submit the form and attached files to Mongodb-Atlas.
- The form will be able to POST with:
    - one document of types img/pdf/doc/txt, or
    - two or more documents of types img/pdf/doc/txt, or
    - zero documents attached
- Retrieve a document and its associated files and display the document details with links to the files.
- Click on any of the associated links and view the document.

Technologies used:
- Gridfs and Multer
- Mongodb-Atlas and Mongoose
