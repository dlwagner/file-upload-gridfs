### File Upload and Download Using Gridfs and MongoDB

## Description
This application demonstrates simple file upload and download capabilities using 
MongoDB Atlas and Gridfs. The application mimics something like a bug tracker. You
create an issue and attach files supporting your issue. You can then review an issue
and click on any of the attachments and see the attachment open in a new window. 

## Installation
1. Create a MongoDB Atlas database and collection.
2. Clone this repo.
3. Open the project in your dev console (VSCode is good).
4. Create a .env file and add your MongoDB connection string.
5. Run `npm install` on the command line.
6. Open your browser to localhost:3000.
7. That should do it.
